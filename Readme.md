# JavaFX ToDo App

A basic Todo app created by me with beginner level code. Hopefully I will improve it to somewhat fancy. The app lets you
add tasks, mark them as completed, and view both current and completed tasks. Note that the app currently doesn't have
the capability to save tasks to the local machine.

## Features

- Add tasks to the current task list.
- Mark tasks as completed and move them to the completed task list.
- View both current and completed tasks.

## Requirements

- Java 20
- JavaFX library
